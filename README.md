# TokenLog-SoftGov
MISSION, VISION, VALUES

**TL;DR** 

We are revisiting the TEC mission, vision and values and proposing new statements using [Tokenlog](https://tokenlog.xyz/TECommons/TokenLog-SoftGov) to pick the best ones. Everyone can participate and CSTK and Impact Hour token holders can vote! There are only 2 steps, proposing and voting. Scroll down to the instructions if you have questions and feel free to reach out.

The very first move of the Cultural Build was to iterate on the mission, vision and values of the TEC. It seemed appropriate to understand the direction of the path we want to open before just walking in it. A big learning from this early step is that we needed a decision making process before making any decision :sweat_smile:

Now, we have Tokenlog, an incredible decision making tool that uses quadratic voting and fits perfectly the Mission use case. Tokenlog will also be used to pick the TEC Hatch DAO parameters so it’s a great timing to get familiar with it.

Nevertheless the early stage, the first iteration of the mission, vision and values was so valuable and this Miro board still offers key insights.
We have evolved immensely since day one of the Cultural Build and we count now with 270+ active contributors and Hatchers who should have an opportunity to collaborate with our mission, vision and value statements.

**Here are the former statements for reference:**

### **TEC Vision**

The TEC envisions a world with safe digital socio-economic public infrastructures that are diversely designed and aligned with collective needs.

### **Values**

The TEC operates from a prosocial human centered perspective.
We hold ourselves to high standards of safety, resilience, and integrity.
We encourage our members to be radically open source, non-hierarchical, creative, transparent in their intentions and accountable for their actions.
We are value driven, (not profit driven) and will strive to support token engineering projects that appreciate the value of public goods and ethical, inclusive economic systems.

### **Near Term Mission**

Our primary goal in the near term is to get the Token Engineering Commons (TEC) launched, and operating, with a resilient culture. Once launched, the TEC (smart contracts and culture built around it) will align incentives around advancing the token engineering discipline.

There are a many requirements to fulfill, these are just some of the most important:

The TEC will be launched by a Trusted Seed, a critical mass of token engineering, decentralized governance, and commons management “experts.”
The TEC will consist of an Augmented Bonding Curve (or similar bonding curve) feeding into a community pool of funds that can be disbursed using Conviction Funding.
The Token Engineering Commons will be able to be upgradable so that it can improve upon its initial design.
The cultural and technical build are currently happening to ensure a successful launch of the TEC and are the focus until they are completed and the TEC is allocating funding to support TE Public Goods.

### **Long Term Mission**

The TE Commons mission is to gather and steward the efficient distribution of funds to projects in the emerging field of token engineering to encourage the robust and ethical design of tokenized infrastructures. The TE Commons will curate and connect projects to the resources they need, while also evolving and maintaining our own healthy culture & regenerative infrastructure where capital supports contributions, contributions create value, value empowers token engineers, and people who appreciate token engineers being empowered contribute capital of all sorts.

### **So how is this gonna work?**

## **Step 1 - PROPOSING**

- [Go to Tokenlog](https://tokenlog.xyz/TECommons/TokenLog-SoftGov) · Token-weighted backlogs 1

- To submit a proposal is super easy, click on “new issue”. This will bring you to a Github issue template which you should fill with one statement for the mission, one for vision and one for values. This time we aren’t doing “Near” and “Long” term missions, just Mission, since we are so close to hatching.

- You can be creative with the title :slight_smile:

- Click “Submit new issue” and it will pop up automatically on Tokenlog.

### **What if someone sent a mission and values I like but I want to change the vision?**

- Copy and paste their mission and values and give them the credit by mentioning the number of their issue.
- Create your version of the mission and submit the issue.
- This is valid for any combinations between the 3 statements .
### **What if I want to change something small or just the wording of a proposal?**

- Leave a comment on the issue you’re looking at, the owner might want to incorporate your feedback!
- If they don’t reply within a day or don’t want to incorporate the suggestion you’re encouraged to post your own proposal with your name and mention it’s a FORK of proposal x in the title.

## **Step 2 - VOTING** 

- You can vote if you’re a member of the Trusted Seed Association
- Go to Tokenlog · Token-weighted backlogs 1
- Choose the xDAI network on your wallet
- Click “connect” on the top right corner, make sure to be logged in your Trusted Seed address
- Pick your favorite proposals and distribute your votes!

### **How is the winner chosen?** 

If a proposal has over 50% of the total voting power, then it is the winner. Otherwise, the top 3 to 5 submissions will have another voting round and the one with more votes will win. Because of the potential for votes to be split amongst forked proposals that are similar, the Community Stewards will choose the top submissions for the run-off.

### **What if there is a polarized scenario, where 2 to 3 different proposals have an evenly split majority of votes in the run-off?** 

In this case, the top 2 or 3 authors will be invited to a hack session to merge their proposals together and the result will be the mission vision and values.
